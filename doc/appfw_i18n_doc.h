 * @section CAPI_I18N_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * The @ref CAPI_I18N_MODULE API provides functions to write multilingual applications through GNU gettext.
 * <p>
 * Tizen provides all the features of the GNU gettext library through the Internationalization API
 * and allows you to manage message catalogs from SDK.
 * <p>
 * The Internationalization API consists of i18n_get_text() for message translation
 * and macros to use i18n_get_text() in an easy to use form.
 * These macros allow you to mark strings for translation in source codes,
 * which are replaced with the translated strings at runtime.
