 /**
 * @ingroup CAPI_APPLICATION_MODULE
 * @defgroup CAPI_ALARM_MODULE Alarm
 * @brief The @ref CAPI_ALARM_MODULE API allows setting an "alarm clock" for the delivery of a notification at some point in the future.
 *
 * @section CAPI_ALARM_MODULE_HEADER Required Header
 *   \#include <app_alarm.h>
 *
 * @section CAPI_ALARM_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * Mobile devices typically give constant access to information from various sources. Some of this information is best delivered
 * through alarms - the most obvious case is a calendar scheduling application which lets you know when a meeting is about to start.
 * Alarms are certainly better than actively waiting in a loop.  They are also better than putting an interface to sleep because they do not
 * block your main UI thread.  Use of alarms helps build smooth user experiences and implements unattended data synchronization tasks.
 * If an application is installed after setting the alarm, your alarm is cancelled automatically.\n
 * When the alarm is expired, Alarm Manager will turn on LCD to prohibit background jobs.
 * If you want to use alarm API without turning on LCD, you can use alarm_schedule_after_delay().
 *
 * There are 3 ways to set an alarm.
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 *    <th>FUNCTION</th>
 *    <th>DESCRIPTION </th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *	<td>alarm_schedule_once_after_delay()</td>
 *	<td>Sets an alarm to be triggered at specific time once</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *	<td>alarm_schedule_once_at_date()</td>
 *	<td>Sets an alarm to be triggered after specific delay once</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *	<td>alarm_schedule_with_recurrence_week_flag()</td>
 *	<td>Sets an alarm to be triggered at specific time with recurrent days of the week(can repeat on days of the week)</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *	<td>alarm_schedule_after_delay()</td>
 *	<td>Sets an alarm to be triggered after specific time(Since 2.4, this api does not support exact period and delay for minimizing the wakeups of the device. The system can adjust when the alarm expires.)</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * \n
